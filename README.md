# Website Design System

I have been given a project from codecademy to create a website with knowledge of 
creating a website design system.


## Technology

This project will consist of:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

Javascript isn't in the initial project goals but I am thinking I want to have some form of user interaction.

## Project Goals

The project states it should include:

* Color Ideas.
* Fonts Styles.
* Repeating Styles.
* Other Ideas.


## color ideas

I will create a section with various colors within, and other forms of information where they could use 
rgb, # or hsl format.

## Font Styles

They are five main font families, Serif, Sans-serif, Monospace, Cursive and Fantasy. I believe this covers at
least the majority of fonts avaiable.

So to give the user an idea of the fonts available, I just focus on the basic forms of these.

Later on in the page I will link to Google Fonts, So the user could experiment with fonts of their choosing.

## Repeating Styles

The focus on this section would be to generalise every website you have seen. I will focus on a Home page 
and nav bar to begin with.

I will add more recommendation to this section.

## Other Ideas

I initially had the idea where I want to build a website where I can test various colors and themes by the 
click of a few buttons.

So its going to be very basic at the beginning I am hoping to use this project to grow.

The initial design will be a select a background-color, font-family and font color.

This will be showcased within a website preview section, where the website is a blank general format of a 
website. 

So by the user choosing the a color or font, I am hoping they get an idea of some basics.
